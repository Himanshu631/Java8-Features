Anonymous Inner Class Notes:-

Used when functional interface concept is not applicable.

Used to create a body of a function using interface overriding all methods without creating custom class.
can override multiple methods of the interface unlike functional interfaces.


A variable used inside lambda expression is final

ex:- 

public class Main(){
	private void doSomething(){
		Employee e = () -> {
			int x = 10;             // in this case x is a local variable
			return 100;
		};
		
		Employee e = new Employee() -> {
			int x = 10;				// here x is an instance variable , hence can be accessed using this
			public String getSalary(){   // x need to be declared in the inner class only.
				return this.x;
			}
		};
	}
}
