Functional Interface Notes:-

Interface having exactly one abstract method but can have any number of default and static method. 
We can invoke lambda expression by using functional interface.

Advantage:-
It restrict interface to be a Functional Interface.
example:- If someone has used lambda expression and other person added an abstract method in the interface all lambda expression will have errors

In case of inheritance when a child interface extends a Parent functional interface it would also behave as a Functional Interface.

Interface reference can be used to hold lambda expressions.

Using Lambda expression we don't need to use implementation class.
